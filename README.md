## 🌱 Why Pochkai?

In the sea of generic couple apps, Pochkai focuses on **real connection** — not just chat or calendars. It’s designed for couples who want to:

- 🤝 Set and track goals as a team (savings, travel, health)
- 😌 Stay emotionally in tune through daily mood check-ins
- 🎲 Discover and enjoy each other more through trivia and games
- 🎬 Decide together what to watch (without the 30-minute debate)
- 🪞 Reflect on your relationship with weekly check-ins

Pochkai makes connecting simple, intentional, and even a little fun — every single day.
